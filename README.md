# CodeGraph
CodeGraph is a tool to create and visualize programming algorithms with ease.
## Usage
Go to [the website](https://roger-padrell.github.io/codegraph/), click on new project, add nodes by using right click and connect them.
To save it, you can export it as a .cdg file that will be readable in the editor or export it as a .js or .py file. We are working on implementations for other languages.
